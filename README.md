# Finite Element Methods in Physics - Coursera 

-- Prof. Krishna Garikapati

This repository consists of the modified code submitted for the assigments of the coursera MOOC by University of Michigan on Finite Element Methods. 

There are 4 assigments:
1) 1D Linear Elasticity
2) 2D/3D Steady State Linear Heat Conduction (Scalar Variable)
3) 3D Linear Elasticity (Vector Variable)
4) 3D Transient Linear Heat Conduction

Most of the base code was provided as a part of the course and is available for download in the coursera site

The edited code with solution for assigments is provided within the folders in the repository.
